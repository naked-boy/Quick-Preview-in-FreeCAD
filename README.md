#QuickPreview Overview

QuickPreview is a software or library which is able to render a 3D scene in a second, and allows user to measure objects in the 3D scene.

It reads X3D file and then render it by OpenGL and Glu. GLFW could be used to build the graphic interface of this software. MSXML could be used to parse X3D file.
